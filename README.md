# Hey, I'm MildRacc

I write systems-level code and work on low-level stuff—graphics, embedded systems, hardware design. Most of my work is in Rust and C/C++. Pretty much all my projects come from either wanting to understand how something works or needing a tool that doesn't exist yet.

Everything I make is open-source. I'm a strong believer that hardware, software, and firmware should all have open-source alternatives.

## Projects

**[ShaderShader](https://github.com/MildRacc/shadershader)** - Live GLSL shader editor  
Made this while ricing my Linux setup. Wanted animated wallpapers without killing performance, so I built a simple shader playground that can run as a desktop background.

**[OpenSteamController-Continued](https://github.com/MichaelZaugg/OpenSteamController-Continued)** - Contributor  
Reverse engineered firmware, wrote custom Rust firmware, designed the PCB, and upgraded components from the original Steam Controller.

**[4cast](https://github.com/MildRacc/fourcast)** - LSTM trainer and runner written from scratch in Rust  
I wrote this after a data science internship where I was building LSTM models in Python. Wanted to actually understand how they work, so I implemented the whole thing—backprop, optimization, inference. No ML libraries, just matrix operations.

## What I Work With

I do a lot of graphics programming, embedded systems, and hardware design. I write firmware for microcontrollers, design electronics, and have some experience with Verilog and FPGAs. I also work with networking—protocol implementation and low-level network programming.
